# Swagger generated server for OGC DGGS API testing

## Overview

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

The OpenAPI target definition is of [DGGS API 0.0.6 of the DGGS SWG](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/geofizzydrink/wip-ogc_api_dggs_zone_query_process_style/0.0.6)

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage

We need an env var named TABLES_CONFIG
this TABLES_CONFIG var should hold the path to a file# based on the
tables.template.conf wich holds the access info to the clickhouse database server

```
# for example
export TABLES_CONFIG=$HOME/tables.conf

```


To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# configure clickhouse db access
export TABLES_CONFIG=tables.template.conf

python3 -m dggs_api_server

# or for dev and testing
# python server.py
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/dggs-api/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/dggs-api/openapi.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

*Remark: I haven't had time to update the tests, please feel free to do so*

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t dggs_api_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 dggs_api_server
```
